<p>If the internet taught us anything is how to get things done.
The death of long, cumbersome waterfall practices and the birth of the quick and iterative agile methodology is core to countless dollars changing hands in and around digital products.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The core concept is pretty simple: Thinking – Idea – Build – Traction – Success</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Thinking</h4>

<p>All ideas come from exploration. In the course of which we might link previous knowledge with new experiences. Curiosity around a topic will often trigger further reading, new conversations and independent exploration. Those seeds will wait for new motivation to trigger an idea. Experience and professional expertise will then help us predict if its worth committing to.</p>

<h4>Idea</h4>

<p>After a certain amount of exploration we will hopefully get to a meaningful place, mature enough to harvest. Where research will become applied and targeted at what will be required to execute the idea (an understanding of the sector and logistical considerations among others things).
Evaluating an idea is in itself an art and a science, which is beyond the scope of this piece (and is what makes VCs, CEOs and strategies good at what they do).</p>

<h4>Build</h4>

<p>Bootstrapped, or financed, an MVP will need to be built. The goal is to prove the concept. First internally with the team and then later in the wild through various stages of beta testings.
Agile cycle of design, developments and adjustment will pave the way for mass traction. Which will prove a product’s readiness for the market.</p>

<h4>Traction</h4>

<p>A lot has gone into the pot by now. The founders are likely to have bet their savings on the success of this idea, engineers and designers might have been promised equity, and seeds have been planted with VCs.
The team lives the product 24 / 7 — promoting it with as many people as possible. The goal is aggressive marketing, manually getting the product with as many people possible, showing numbers where it matters.</p>

<h4>Success</h4>

<p>This stage could have many different faces, but on a conceptual level the importance of this step is validation. The company may very well be running on the fumes of the core hypothesis at this point.</p>

<p>If validated – funding will come in, people will start getting paid, alarm bells will go off and the business will reach a healthier place. The alternatives are that the idea failed, or that the company is sold.</p>

<h3>Sustainability of Thinking</h3>

<p>This raises a question of sustainability.
If we accept that we only have a certain stock of thinking in us (individually and as an industry) then by extension we need to use it in the most sustainable way.</p>

<p>Aggressive cycles of success and failures yield short lived businesses, but more importantly short lived thinking.
This becomes more urgent when we begin to consider the amount of designing and building that we as an industry have been producing.</p>

<p>Anything that we can physically think of, will be built. Thinking of an idea, makes it a reality.
This notion challenges the taxonomy under which we examine ideas and build products.</p>

<p>If we no longer need to be first, we essentially remove time from a product’s cycle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can we iterate our thinking rather than on a hard coded solution?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New technologies and products that use machine learning show us a future where a human needn’t code each and every outcome. Machines can make assumptions and will require much deeper thinking.</p>

<p>MVC based products will be replaced by far longer lasting paradigms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know that technology is getting better, smaller and cheaper. Companies that focus on short term gains through nothing more than MVPs, manual traction and short financial gains make themselves obsolete in this new reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a graph where x represents time and y is thinking — could it be that we only started scratching the surface of what’s possible? The urgency to build, before anyone else will, made us move from thinking to building too soon.</p>

<p>Can come up with new thinking paradigms that can live up to technologies we haven’t built yet (but we know are coming)?</p>
