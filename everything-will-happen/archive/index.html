            It wasn’t until recently that machine learning moved from medical labs (Spanr, genomics analysis) and search algorithms enhancement. Google’s recent acquisition of Deep Mind, IBM’s push of Watson and other viral developments signal a looming shift into consumer products. As machine learning will be making its way into consumer hands there is going to be a need for design thinking to lead the way in shaping products for the consumer market. Modern product design has established its role in linking business and strategic thinking with design; through metrics and iterative processes, businesses can now rely on strong product staff to...

            output_00001 by Kynd.info The field of AI is complex and multi–faceted. Its challenges are likely to bring together disciplines which traditionally had little overlap. Education, psychology, math, technology, and philosophy. We don’t know what designing for AI will look like—but we do know that It will be different in just about every way from what we’re used to. Systems not Views AI–driven products will involve new workflow, different sets of moving parts, and new type of relational logic. One way to untangle this problem is to find a common, ubiquitous element in today’s digital design, and consider how likely is...

            Steven Siegel– Office Building Lobby 1 Model View Controller is a server architecture model that was invented by Trygve Reenskaug in the late 70s. Originally a system to implement graphic user interfaces for desktop machine it is now the core of practically anything we refer to as digital product. The essential purpose of MVC is to bridge the gap between the human user’s mental model and the digital model that exists in the computer. The ideal MVC solution supports the user illusion of seeing and manipulating the domain information directly. The structure is useful if the user needs to see...

            If the internet taught us anything is how to get things done. The death of long, cumbersome waterfall practices and the birth of the quick and iterative agile methodology is core to countless dollars changing hands in and around digital products. The core concept is pretty simple: Thinking – Idea – Build – Traction – Success Thinking All ideas come from exploration. In the course of which we might link previous knowledge with new experiences. Curiosity around a topic will often trigger further reading, new conversations and independent exploration. Those seeds will wait for new motivation to trigger an idea. Experience...

            &ldquo;Hard technology makes us subservient, Soft technology puts us in charge&rdquo; (Norman, D. A., &amp; Dunaeff, T.) To understand soft technology and its intent we should first understand hard technology. Traditional definitions of soft and hard technology differ depending on who you ask. Some link the physical nature of the technology to the taxonomy.Logistics and machinery is hard technology, and software, processes and production techniques as soft. Dron, J., Reiners, T., &amp; Gregory, S. (2011) claim soft technology is as an abstract notion that “exists mainly in people’s heads” They use the term for all ephemeral and non–executional abilities required...

&ldquo;Although it should be read as science fiction, current trends in miniaturization and price reduction almost guarantee that many of notions discussed will actually happen in the near future&rdquo;

Alan C. Kay–Xerox Palo Alto Research Center–1972

The nature of this text is philosophical. At times Utopian. The point of the thinking is to provoke a different approach to designing technology. More responsible, sustainable and conducive to our future.

Moving focus from abilities, to intent, from efficiency to merit.
